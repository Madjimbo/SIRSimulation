SIR Simulation Coursework â€“ Game Theory 2024/25

The program outputs .csv files with data for Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R) agents over time.

Repository Structure:
- Main.java
- Simulation.java
- Agent.java


Git Branches and Versions:
Each part is separated into Git branches:
- base-sir: Basic All-to-All model
- random-graph: Adds random graph topology
- vaccination: Includes vaccination strategy
- final

How to switch versions:
git clone https://github.com/Madjimbo/SIRSimulation.git  
cd SIRSimulation  
git checkout base-sir

Replace `base-sir` with `random-graph`, `vaccination`, or `final` to view other stages.
